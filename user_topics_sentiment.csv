@calvinburr1248,-0.8622,1,"I've said it several times before, and each time it seems more urgent and more necessary.  The board of directors or whoever might have the power to do so should remove Musk as the face and voice of Tesla.  He is hurting the company and its brand, he is hurting the employees, and he is hurting the people who have invested in the company.   Describing Musk as a juvenile jerk is an understatement, and that is the reason why people like Warren Buffett have decided not to risk investing in Tesla.   Musk has some serious psychological problems and is unstable."

@rick_1_grimes,-0.3235,2,"In the 1920s and 1930s, the Italian fascists began using the Roman salute as a greeting to emphasize the connection of the renewed Italy with the traditions of Ancient Rome. Following their example, the German Nazis adopted the Nazi salute, which visually resembles a Roman salute. The similarity of the gestures has led to confusion, especially since the outbreak of World War II. From 1939 until the attack on Pearl Harbor, opponents of U.S. involvement in the war tried not to use the Bellamy salute, so that they would not be considered supporters of the Nazis. For example, the famous American pilot Charles Lindbergh and his supporters were forced to justify themselves and prove that Lindbergh did not support Hitler and that the photographs showed not a Nazi greeting, but a Bellamy salute. Biographer Scott Berg argues that the scandalous photos were taken without capturing the U.S. flag, which makes the Bellamy salute indistinguishable from the Nazi salute.

On December 22, 1942, Congress passed amendments to the United States Flag Code and the oath to the flag was pronounced with the right hand palm over the heart."

All the mad lefties saying people wont believe what's right in front of their eyes, yet they wont admit the second ""salute"" looks completely different. His first one was off to the side with a straight arm (yes, resembling the nazi salute 100%) but the second was forwards and with a bent arm. That tells me he was actually trying to gesture giving his heart to the audience. Obviously he should've clarified further than just saying ""nuh uh"" on Twitter, but to say he did the EXACT SAME gesture twice is over the top and quite a stretch."

@SeaStar2722,-0.8971,2,"Ok, some reporter is now saying: ""Elon Musk's Biographer Calls Him a 'Sociopath' After Auschwitz Photo-Op."" These reporters are so petty to get a bite, to create a scandal, and to get paid. They create issues and mess with people's lives. Elon is a genius in his own right. People like him are also a bit autistic or ADHD or have some other similar traits. They act differently but without malice. Elon sometimes seems playful, laughs a lot, and can be a bit out of focus when it is not something he is inclined towards. Genius people are also very down-to-earth and carefree, which can be misinterpreted as not caring, but they do have deep emotions that they do not show on the outside. So, reporters, before creating defamation issues, educate yourself. Enough of the false news. That is why reporters are less liked and not welcomed by the American people, and those they interview fear them. We know they make stories of their own to sell a note. Shame on you! However, Elon is not perfect and can make mistakes, but that doesn't justify the media's relentless attacks."
@DaveWilliams-r5v,0.6643,1,"In my dictionary a 'smart arse' whose not smart is an 'arse'. Do the math. The '1st law of thermodynamics' is the most important law in all of nature. In other words 'life is a zero sum'. If these clowns succeed in taking America where they plan to, it will come at the expense of every other country and all of the natural resources. An ugly 4 minute start to an uglier 4 years. His statement ""thanks to you, the future of civilization is assured"" is my candidate as the most regrettable comment linked to this administration. The earlier you personally go to Mars, the better."

Perhaps it's coming from the same place.. a loving aggression.
 That's what i think defined Hitler's evil, ironically, was a Love for the German people, coupled with an aggression to attack those holding them back.
Elon had a love for the American people... he will attack those holding America back, but that will limited to the corrupt bureaucracy. There's no indication that he will attack other races or countries. His vision is much better developed than that of Hitler.

I know the President was very tired because he had a busy day and then to go through all that was a little to much.  They could have put off some of the things on a different day like all that military marching etc.  Most of this could have been put off until a nice day in March.  It was just way to long and tiring for most people, older and younger.  I know the president is glad it is over so he can start to work running the country.  Maybe it was just me because i am 92 and it seem like a long time. God Bless the United States.  My vote went for Trump , Thank God he won."

‚ÄúSpiritual wickedness in high places‚Äù is what you must war against‚Ä¶not just flesh and blood. Pray always! Speak to men who know The Lord‚Ä¶like Rev. Graham. Only by keeping God in the center of your fight can you, and this nation, win! We the people are behind you! Read the Bible every day/night, even if it‚Äôs only a few verses. Or listen to it on some media, as you drift off to sleep each night; picking up where you last remember, the next night. 
I pray God bless and keep you, and your family."

@franciscosouzaaguirre9688,0.5545,2,"So, to anyone saying ""That's not a nazi salute, it's a roman salute"", quite a few things:
The roman salute is literally the fascist/nazi salute. Someone doing it is doing the nazi salute.

Also, roman salute is a misnomer, it was never a thing in ancient Rome. The idea originates mainly from the painting ""Le Serment des Horaces"", where the characters from the painting are swearing and oath by raising their hands, and from ancient statues depicting emperors and important romans (like the famous statue of Augustus) doing an oratorial sign addressing the people, with their hand partially raised (erroneously attributed as ""the roman salute"", but it looks nothing like it, the arm is not fully extended, the hand is in different position and the purpose of it isn't to salute but to address an audience of people). It's basically a pop history myth, made popular by movies and tv shows where you have legionaries doing it, when it's actually bs.
 The roman salute is a fascist and nazi thing, not a roman thing at all."

@pgiannoulou,0.9854,2,"I am not surprised by the fact that many Americans do not know their history. Many people, even in my country Greece, believe that this greeting comes from either ancient Greece or ancient Rome, but this is not written anywhere. This greeting historically first appeared in the 19th century in the United States of America. The creator of the greeting was Francis Julius Bellamy. It seems that he wanted to sell some flags through the company he worked for, to American schools. So on 12/10/1892 he found the opportunity to create the greeting. The greeting means the hand first to the heart and then extended towards the American flag. There are also photographic documents that show children in American schools during the term of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt greeting with Bellamy's greeting. Unfortunately, this salute was abolished in 1942 because it was considered a Nazi symbol. Now the question is: how did the Bellamy salute get appropriated by the fascists and the Nazis? Well, after the first world war, Gabriele D'Annunzio (an Italian Nazi poet and military man) stole the salute and in order not to say that the salute was American, he lied that it came from ancient Rome. That's what happened."

Upham as the gesture that was to accompany the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States of America, whose text had been written by Francis Bellamy. It was also known as the ""flag salute"" during the period when it was used with the Pledge of Allegiance. Bellamy promoted the salute and it came to be associated with his name. Both the Pledge and its salute originated in 1892. Later, during the 1920s and 1930s, Italian fascists and Nazi Germans adopted a salute which was very similar, attributed to the so-called Roman salute, a gesture is wrongly attributed to having been used in ancient Rome."

@sophia-z9q,0.7842,2,its not a nazi salute. if you watch him in other rallys he sometimes cheers diffrently than others. and you can see he is sometimes not good at reading the room. after he did the motion he said ‚Äúmy heart goes out to yall‚Äù he just did a hand motion from his heart to the people. some people are just dumb and want attention so they make up stupid stuff.

@TheGudsdotter,-0.7447,2,"I can understand the gesture perfectly. He puts the hand to the hart = my love, he puts the arm out to the people = it is to you all, and toghether with what he said it means - I love you all for you have made this happened. To try this to mean anything else is just pure evil.  Many of my  people were  killed by Hitler and I am no lover of Nazi ideology,  but I can use my brain and Elon is not a follower of Nazi ideology. To read the comments to Elons` gesture is very disturbing to me. It is like people love to think ill of others and therefore willfully misunderstand them. If you all out there are going to think that all who makes a gesture like that is a Nazi then you will get crazy. Why not go against the real Jew haters who are walking on the streets and scream free Palestine and by that are asking for a genocide of the Jewish people. Or are you one of them who think they have the right to do so, then you should not blame Musk because then you are on the side of them who wants the dead of the Jewish people."

@Crypt0n1an,0.9914,2,"That's not a nazi salute, give me a break. So now any time a person puts their arm up to greet someone they are performing a nazi salute? A nazi salute is a very specific gesture, for one it does not start by putting your hand on your heart first, secondly the arm comes up stiff straight and  parallel to the body(ie not at an angle to the body) up to about 45 degrees with the palm also stiff straight and face down. The gesture is suppose to to last at least a few seconds in that position. None of what Elon did fits the description of a nazi salute. His arm was not stiff, came up almost sideways, his fingers were not stiff and straight and his palm was also not at the proper angle while he first put his hand on his heart each time he did it. That last point should tell you something, it should tell you that most likely what this insanely wealthy mildly autistic super genius was doing was trying to signal a sign  of appreciation and love for the audience which he also at some point verbalized right after the gesture, ""my heart goes out to you"" he tells them. That is all it was.

Do people realize how easy it is to confuse a simple gesture of greeting with a nazi salute? This is just the left doing what they usually do which is warp reality to suit their political and ideological aims."

@OryXity,0.9895,2,"We just gonna forget that eggsy does a nazi salute when he first enters the secret changing room when asked for his ""best impression of an austrian aristocrat"" in 'kingsman : the secret service'??
Are we not going to recognize that intention and outward appearance are not correlated in the slightest
If a racist saying racist things does that salute, he's probably aligned with the nazis
If a character in a tv show does it very clearly for a joke, they probably arent racist
If a man saying ""my hearts goes out to them"" put his open palmed spread fingers hand on his heart (the american show of respect) then throws it out to the crowd closed fingers, thats him showing he is throwing his heart to the audience and is probably not being racist
Plus a nazi salute begins from closed fingers across the chest perpendicular, like the french 'quinelle' salute and generally they would stamp their opposite foot as they extended their arm
He literally just did a salute, get over yourselves, you arent going to catch the next adolf by watching him out himself on body language alone on the news smh

How tf is he gonna do the salute that means ""glory to the fuhrer"" or more accurately ""glory to the dictator"" when there isnt a fuhrer/dictator to salute...
And while saluting a CROWD...
(Also Hitler wouldnt nazi salute to his people, his people would do it towards him and he would hold his arm directly up by his side, accepting their worship essentially, so elon wouldnt be the one doing the salute if he's supposed to be 'hitler' as so many claim)"

@TwitterNewsNotOnTwitter,0.9709,2,"i aint amercian but this is not the ""salute""
if you do the salute you have to be straight with a straight 45 degrees 
elon is leaning to the left almost jumping out the air + if you look his hand is leaning a bit up around 5-10 degrees
he also touches his stomach BEFORE he does salute which if people wanted to use that. the mustache guy would do it at the same time.
and his hand is not straight its loose
""the right arm stiff to an upward 45¬∞ angle and then straightening the hand so that it is parallel to the arm.""
and usually people saluting which in every picture on google they would look towards their salute and straighten. unless u the mustache guy
elon is not straightening his body towards the people he is looking at.
so in other words

his body is not straight, his arm is to the side. his hand is loose. his hand is not straight. 
if he really wanted to do the salute it wouldnt take more than literally 10 seconds to learn how to do it right."

@salahudeenmoses4093,0.8717,0,"America: The Revolution Has Started.
America, It's Time for a Change: Stop Buying Tesla!
It's time to reconsider our support for Tesla, a company that is straying from American values. Once a symbol of American ingenuity, Tesla now prioritizes profits over workers.
 1. The Gigafactory in China: The largest Tesla Gigafactory is in China, reflecting a strategic choice that undermines American workers. Why support a company that invests in another country?
 2. Disrespecting American Workers: Tesla has laid off skilled American engineers for cheaper foreign labor, threatening job security. Is this the corporate America we want? 
3. The Cost of Cheap Labor: The pursuit of cheaper labor exploits workers and undermines the middle class, which has long been the backbone of our strength. 
4. A Call for Accountability: We must support companies prioritizing American jobs and values. Tesla no longer embodies our spirit of innovation; it sacrifices American jobs for foreign interests. 
Let‚Äôs stop buying Tesla and support companies that invest in our future and believe in American workers. Together, we can choose America again.""Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe."" Albert Einstein"

@mizzflex2,0.8952,2,"He has Asperger‚Äôs Disease. He does things a little differently which makes him come off as socially awkward. 

His hand gesture was meant to add a greater impact to what he said which was ‚ÄúMy heart goes out to you.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break it down. He put his hand on his chest where his heart is to signalize ‚ÄúMy heart‚Äù. Then he extended his arm outward towards the audience to signalize ‚Äúgoes out to you‚Äù. Act out those two simple gestures as quick consecutive motions and voila - inadvertently looks very much like a racist gesture.

If you‚Äôre against Trump but still active on these platforms, you‚Äôre inadvertently supporting his supporters. Most are probably those who that posted that black square for BLM yet stay on these apps since Trump‚Äôs rise. That‚Äôs hypocrisy at its finest!

Instead of just complaining, take meaningful action. Break away from systems and platforms that empower the very ideologies you oppose. Complaining while still feeding into these systems isn‚Äôt resistance‚Äîit‚Äôs complicity."

@politicalsideshow,0.9798,1,"TLDR: Watching billionaires embrace authoritarian rhetoric isn‚Äôt surprising.  It‚Äôs consistent with capitalism‚Äôs DNA, self-interest. Think of our Constitutional Republic vs an unregulated me-first version of capitalism as opposing forces. Democracy distributes power and Capitalism concentrates it.  As wealth becomes more concentrated, it protects itself by buying political power. 

Concentrated wealth then uses the us-versus-them culture-war industry makes authoritarianism feel normal. Right now we‚Äôre seeing tech billionaires framing themselves as warrior-priests and philosopher-kings who should be able to rule without the consent of the governed.  

The pattern is clear:

Buy media platforms
Fund thinks tanks
Control information flow
Drive public opinion
Shape favorable economic policy
Destabilize democratic institutions 
Neutralize ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù

This is not a conspiracy - it‚Äôs money protecting money. 

Again, when wealth inequality reaches extreme levels, protecting that wealth becomes more valuable than maintaining our constitutional republic. The ultra-wealthy start viewing democracy as a threat to their financial position. This is nothing new. They have always done this. Except now, they‚Äôve learned to use patriotic overtones while pushing unpatriotic policies. They talk about freedom while building systems of control. Classic doublespeak but with incredible branding. 

The real question isn‚Äôt whether billionaires will support authoritarian movements - history shows they do. The question is whether democratic institutions, powered by ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù are strong enough to resist capital‚Äôs gravitational pull. 

This isn‚Äôt about individuals. You‚Äôre not the enemy. This is about systems and incentives. When we fixate on personalities, we ignore the hidden forces at work."

After saying this man should never be president well when you hold a certain position, even if you disagree with the decision of voters that doesn‚Äôt mean that your position doesn‚Äôt require you to hold some sort of decorum to carry yourself in some sort of way.  I‚Äôll give you an example if a board of directors has a few people that says this person should not be CEO, but they are outvoted. Guess what they still have to carry on as the board of directors of the company even if that person is elected to CEO and they have to work with that person who was elected CEO for the better of the corporation.
