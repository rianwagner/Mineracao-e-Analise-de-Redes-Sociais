Following their example, the German Nazis adopted the Nazi salute, which visually resembles a Roman salute. The similarity of the gestures has led to confusion, especially since the outbreak of World War II. From 1939 until the attack on Pearl Harbor, opponents of U.S. involvement in the war tried not to use the Bellamy salute, so that they would not be considered supporters of the Nazis. For example, the famous American pilot Charles Lindbergh and his supporters were forced to justify themselves and prove that Lindbergh did not support Hitler and that the photographs showed not a Nazi greeting, but a Bellamy salute. Biographer Scott Berg argues that the scandalous photos were taken without capturing the U.S. flag, which makes the Bellamy salute indistinguishable from the Nazi salute.\n\nOn December 22, 1942, Congress passed amendments to the United States Flag Code and the oath to the flag was pronounced with the right hand palm over the heart.",

That tells me he was actually trying to gesture giving his heart to the audience.

They create issues and mess with people's lives. Elon is a genius in his own right. People like him are also a bit autistic or ADHD or have some other similar traits. They act differently but without malice. Elon sometimes seems playful, laughs a lot, and can be a bit out of focus when it is not something he is inclined towards. Genius people are also very down-to-earth and carefree, which can be misinterpreted as not caring, but they do have deep emotions that they do not show on the outside. So, reporters, before creating defamation issues, educate yourself. Enough of the false news. That is why reporters are less liked and not welcomed by the American people, and those they interview fear them. We know they make stories of their own to sell a note. Shame on you! However, Elon is not perfect and can make mistakes, but that doesn't justify the media's relentless attacks.",

I know the President was very tired because he had a busy day and then to go through all that was a little to much.  They could have put off some of the things on a different day like all that military marching etc.  Most of this could have been put off until a nice day in March.  It was just way to long and tiring for most people, older and younger.  I know the president is glad it is over so he can start to work running the country.  Maybe it was just me because i am 92 and it seem like a long time. God Bless the United States.  My vote went for Trump , Thank God he won.",

THAT is why God allowed it and held you from the office for four years. He wanted you to learn the demons this country must fight against, which would take time. \n“Spiritual wickedness in high places” is what you must war against…not just flesh and blood. Pray always! Speak to men who know The Lord…like Rev. Graham. Only by keeping God in the center of your fight can you, and this nation, win! We the people are behind you! Read the Bible every day/night, even if it’s only a few verses. Or listen to it on some media, as you drift off to sleep each night; picking up where you last remember, the next night. \nI pray God bless and keep you, and your family.",

Someone doing it is doing the nazi salute.\n\nAlso, roman salute is a misnomer, it was never a thing in ancient Rome. The idea originates mainly from the painting \"Le Serment des Horaces\", where the characters from the painting are swearing and oath by raising their hands, and from ancient statues depicting emperors and important romans (like the famous statue of Augustus) doing an oratorial sign addressing the people, with their hand partially raised (erroneously attributed as \"the roman salute\", but it looks nothing like it, the arm is not fully extended, the hand is in different position and the purpose of it isn't to salute but to address an audience of people). It's basically a pop history myth, made popular by movies and tv shows where you have legionaries doing it, when it's actually bs.\n The roman salute is a fascist and nazi thing, not a roman thing at all.",

The fact that Elon proudly did the Nazi salute TWICE and millions continued cheering is absolutely horrific. There are no words powerful enough to describe the danger we're in.",

Many people, even in my country Greece, believe that this greeting comes from either ancient Greece or ancient Rome, but this is not written anywhere. This greeting historically first appeared in the 19th century in the United States of America. The creator of the greeting was Francis Julius Bellamy. It seems that he wanted to sell some flags through the company he worked for, to American schools. So on 12/10/1892 he found the opportunity to create the greeting. The greeting means the hand first to the heart and then extended towards the American flag. There are also photographic documents that show children in American schools during the term of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt greeting with Bellamy's greeting. Unfortunately, this salute was abolished in 1942 because it was considered a Nazi symbol. Now the question is: how did the Bellamy salute get appropriated by the fascists and the Nazis? Well, after the first world war, Gabriele D'Annunzio (an Italian Nazi poet and military man) stole the salute and in order not to say that the salute was American, he lied that it came from ancient Rome. That's what happened.",

Upham as the gesture that was to accompany the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States of America, whose text had been written by Francis Bellamy. It was also known as the \"flag salute\" during the period when it was used with the Pledge of Allegiance. Bellamy promoted the salute and it came to be associated with his name. Both the Pledge and its salute originated in 1892. Later, during the 1920s and 1930s, Italian fascists and Nazi Germans adopted a salute which was very similar, attributed to the so-called Roman salute, a gesture is wrongly attributed to having been used in ancient Rome.",

To try this to mean anything else is just pure evil.  Many of my  people were  killed by Hitler and I am no lover of Nazi ideology,  but I can use my brain and Elon is not a follower of Nazi ideology. To read the comments to Elons` gesture is very disturbing to me. It is like people love to think ill of others and therefore willfully misunderstand them. If you all out there are going to think that all who makes a gesture like that is a Nazi then you will get crazy. Why not go against the real Jew haters who are walking on the streets and scream free Palestine and by that are asking for a genocide of the Jewish people. Or are you one of them who think they have the right to do so, then you should not blame Musk because then you are on the side of them who wants the dead of the Jewish people.",

A nazi salute is a very specific gesture, for one it does not start by putting your hand on your heart first, secondly the arm comes up stiff straight and  parallel to the body(ie not at an angle to the body) up to about 45 degrees with the palm also stiff straight and face down. The gesture is suppose to to last at least a few seconds in that position. None of what Elon did fits the description of a nazi salute. His arm was not stiff, came up almost sideways, his fingers were not stiff and straight and his palm was also not at the proper angle while he first put his hand on his heart each time he did it. That last point should tell you something, it should tell you that most likely what this insanely wealthy mildly autistic super genius was doing was trying to signal a sign  of appreciation and love for the audience which he also at some point verbalized right after the gesture, \"my heart goes out to you\" he tells them. That is all it was.\n\nDo people realize how easy it is to confuse a simple gesture of greeting with a nazi salute? This is just the left doing what they usually do which is warp reality to suit their political and ideological aims.",

The guy is totally self aware that this is going to make everyone talk about it, speculate, get complete media attention etc. If I had to guess, he is trolling while also making a statement about free speech. If you really think he is a nazi, you just really want him to be a nazi and hes playing you cause he knows haters will want an excuse to cast someone as a villain. Look, if his actions end up suggesting WW2 era german physical control, I will believe you.  But until then, its a harmless waving of the hand.",

Once a symbol of American ingenuity, Tesla now prioritizes profits over workers.\n 1. The Gigafactory in China: The largest Tesla Gigafactory is in China, reflecting a strategic choice that undermines American workers. Why support a company that invests in another country?\n 2. Disrespecting American Workers: Tesla has laid off skilled American engineers for cheaper foreign labor, threatening job security. Is this the corporate America we want? \n3. The Cost of Cheap Labor: The pursuit of cheaper labor exploits workers and undermines the middle class, which has long been the backbone of our strength. \n4. A Call for Accountability: We must support companies prioritizing American jobs and values. Tesla no longer embodies our spirit of innovation; it sacrifices American jobs for foreign interests. \nLet’s stop buying Tesla and support companies that invest in our future and believe in American workers. Together, we can choose America again.\"Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.\" Albert Einstein",

He put his hand on his chest where his heart is to signalize “My heart”. Then he extended his arm outward towards the audience to signalize “goes out to you”. Act out those two simple gestures as quick consecutive motions and voila - inadvertently looks very much like a racist gesture. \n\nPeople on the left love to accuse the people on the right of racism and bigotry when in actuality it’s the dems are the biggest bigots and racists.

The cracks creep in, insidious as anything I’ve ever seen. It can start with rumblings about an unreliable press and rumors about political enemies that will threaten your family, your children. It can deepen with each disdainful remark about science and art and literature in a pub on a Friday night. It comes cloaked in patriotism and love of country, and uses that as armor against any criticism.\"\n-Brianna Labuskes, from The Librarian of Burned Books",

The same Americans who boycotted companies like Starbucks and Amazon, can’t give up their precious social media even when it conflicts with their moral values.\n\nIf you’re against Trump but still active on these platforms, you’re inadvertently supporting his supporters. Most are probably those who that posted that black square for BLM yet stay on these apps since Trump’s rise. That’s hypocrisy at its finest!\n\nInstead of just complaining, take meaningful action. Break away from systems and platforms that empower the very ideologies you oppose. Complaining while still feeding into these systems isn’t resistance—it’s complicity.",

They gave out free pizza to those who were in line and Free Waters, it was so cool. The place was PACKED. it was so packed that they had to start turning people away at the doors because they were at max capacity. I thought for sure we had a chance. I still stand with who I voted for. It hurts so much to see how my country is going down so fast.  We didn’t want to be dragged down to ruins because YOU wanted to save 80 cents on gas. or on eggs. You threw away everyone’s rights, liberties, and freedom away because YOU wanted to save money. YOU wanted cheaper groceries. Yeah, things got expensive. But the orange man has 6-7 bankruptcies to his name!!! and you’re expecting him to lower prices for you?! He can’t even take care of himself and yet, so many people are completely falling for his slogan. It’s not true. I just wanted to say to you foreigners that Not all of us Americans voted for this. we’re stuck here with this mess. Everyday, my heart breaks because I can see how far were sinking. We just keep sinking. and sinking. and sinking.",

            "comment_text": "TLDR: Watching billionaires embrace authoritarian rhetoric isn’t surprising.  It’s consistent with capitalism’s DNA, self-interest. Think of our Constitutional Republic vs an unregulated me-first version of capitalism as opposing forces. Democracy distributes power and Capitalism concentrates it.  As wealth becomes more concentrated, it protects itself by buying political power. \n\nConcentrated wealth then uses the us-versus-them culture-war industry makes authoritarianism feel normal. Right now we’re seeing tech billionaires framing themselves as warrior-priests and philosopher-kings who should be able to rule without the consent of the governed.  \n\nThe pattern is clear:\n\nBuy media platforms\nFund thinks tanks\nControl information flow\nDrive public opinion\nShape favorable economic policy\nDestabilize democratic institutions \nNeutralize “we the people”\n\nThis is not a conspiracy - it’s money protecting money. \n\nAgain, when wealth inequality reaches extreme levels, protecting that wealth becomes more valuable than maintaining our constitutional republic. The ultra-wealthy start viewing democracy as a threat to their financial position. This is nothing new. They have always done this. Except now, they’ve learned to use patriotic overtones while pushing unpatriotic policies. They talk about freedom while building systems of control. Classic doublespeak but with incredible branding. \n\nThe real question isn’t whether billionaires will support authoritarian movements - history shows they do. The question is whether democratic institutions, powered by “we the people” are strong enough to resist capital’s gravitational pull. \n\nThis isn’t about individuals. You’re not the enemy. This is about systems and incentives. When we fixate on personalities, we ignore the hidden forces at work.",

After saying this man should never be president well when you hold a certain position, even if you disagree with the decision of voters that doesn’t mean that your position doesn’t require you to hold some sort of decorum to carry yourself in some sort of way.  I’ll give you an example if a board of directors has a few people that says this person should not be CEO, but they are outvoted. Guess what they still have to carry on as the board of directors of the company even if that person is elected to CEO and they have to work with that person who was elected CEO for the better of the corporation. These men who were formally president of the United States, may not like that Donald Trump was elected, but guess what they still have to carry themselves some type of way they still have to show the office of presidency hold power holds some level of respect that must be honored just because he carries himself like a nut job doesn’t mean they should act like one, even if they want to shun him even if they want to walk away from him they know that they must hold their dignity When others didn’t  it’s all about behaving like your mother taught you too, even if you don’t want to.",
